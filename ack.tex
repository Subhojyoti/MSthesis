I am grateful to my primary thesis advisor Dr. Balaraman Ravindran from Computer Science and Engineering Department at IIT Madras. Without his constant guidance, motivation and perseverance with me, none of these works would have been completed. His courses of Introduction to Machine Learning and Introduction to Reinforcement Learning were my first step into the research world. Not only do these carried a wealth of information but they used to be hugely competitive. Apart from our  formal meetings every week, I used to catch him in his office or in the corridors or anywhere in the department whenever I had any doubts and we used to converse on them. One of great influences of him on me is the constant urge to collaborate with as many interested people as possible.

I am also grateful to my co-advisor Dr. Nandan Sudarsanam from Department of Management Studies at IIT Madras.
