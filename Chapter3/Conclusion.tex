In this chapter, we studied the EUCBV algorithm which takes into account the empirical variance of the arms and employs aggressive exploration parameters in conjunction with non-uniform arm selection (as opposed to UCB-Improved) to eliminate sub-optimal arms. Our theoretical analysis conclusively established that EUCBV exhibits an order-optimal gap-independent regret bound of $O\left(\sqrt{KT}\right)$. Empirically, we show that EUCBV performs superbly across diverse experimental settings and outperforms most of the bandit algorithms in an SMAB setup. Our experiments showed that EUCBV is extremely stable for large horizons and performs consistently well across different types of distributions.
