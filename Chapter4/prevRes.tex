Significant amount of literature is available on the stochastic MAB setting with respect to minimizing the cumulative regret. Chapter \ref{chap:SMAB} and \ref{chap:EUCBV} deals with that. In this work we are particularly interested in \emph{pure-exploration MABs},  where the focus in primarily on simple regret rather than the cumulative regret. The relationship between cumulative regret and simple regret is proved in \citet{bubeck2011pure} where the authors prove that minimizing the simple regret necessarily results in maximizing the cumulative regret.
The pure exploration problem has been explored  mainly under the following two settings:
	
\subsection{Fixed Budget setting} 

Here the learning algorithm has to suggest the best arm(s) within a fixed time-horizon $T$, that is usually given as an input. The objective is to maximize the probability of returning the best arm(s).  This is the scenario we consider in this chapter. Some of the important algorithms used in pure exploration setting are discussed in the next part.

\subsubsection{UCB-Exploration Algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[!h]
\caption{UCBE}
\label{alg:ucbe}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input: } The budget $T$
\State Pull each arm once
\For{$t=K+1,..., T$}
\State Pull the arm such that $\argmax_{i\in \A}\bigg\lbrace\hat{r}_{i} + \sqrt{\dfrac{a}{n_i}}\bigg\rbrace$, where $a = \dfrac{25(T-K)}{36 H_1}$ and $H_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{K}\dfrac{1}{\Delta_i^2}$.
\State $t:=t+1 $
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In \citet{audibert2010best} the authors propose the  UCBE and the Successive Reject (SR) algorithm, and prove simple-regret guarantees for the problem of identifying the single best arm.  In the combinatorial fixed budget setup \citet{gabillon2011multi} propose the GapE and GapE-V algorithms that suggest, with high probability, the best $m$ arms at the end of the time budget. 


\subsubsection{Successive Reject Algorithm}


\begin{algorithm}[h!]
\caption{Successive Reject(SR)}
\label{alg:sr}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input: } The budget $T$
\State \textbf{Initialization: } $n_0 = 0$
\State \textbf{Definition: } $\bar{\log K} = \dfrac{1}{2} + \sum_{i=2}^{K}\dfrac{1}{i}$, $n_k = \dfrac{1}{\bar{\log K}}\dfrac{T-K}{K + 1 - m}$
\For{For each phase $m=1,..., K-1$}
\State For each $i \in B_{m}$, select arm $i$ for $n_k - n_{k-1}$ rounds.
\State Let $B_{m+1} = B_m\setminus \argmin_{i\in B_m} \hat{r}_i$
(remove one element from $B_m$ , if there
is a tie, select randomly the arm to dismiss among the worst arms).
\State $m:=m+1 $
\EndFor
\State Output the single remaining $i\in B_{m}$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


Similarly, \citet{bubeck2013multiple} introduce the  Successive Accept Reject (SAR) algorithm, which is an extension of the SR algorithm; SAR is a round based algorithm whereby at the end of each round an arm is either accepted or rejected (based on certain confidence conditions) until the top $m$ arms are suggested at the end of the budget with high probability. A similar combinatorial setup was explored in \citet{chen2014combinatorial} where the authors propose the Combinatorial Successive Accept Reject (CSAR) algorithm, which is similar in concept to SAR but with a more general setup. 

\subsection{Fixed Confidence setting} 

In this setting the learning algorithm has to suggest the best arm(s) with a fixed confidence (given as input) with as fewer number of attempts as possible. The single best arm identification has been studied in \citet{even2006action}, while for the combinatorial setup \citet{kalyanakrishnan2012pac} have proposed the LUCB algorithm which, on termination, returns  $m$ arms which are at least $\epsilon$ close to the true top-$m$ arms with probability at least $1-\delta$. For a detail survey of this setup we refer the reader to \citet{jamieson2014best}. 

\subsection{Unified Setting}
Apart from these two settings some unified approaches has also been suggested in \citet{gabillon2012best} which proposes the algorithms UGapEb and UGapEc which can work in both the above two settings. The thresholding bandit problem is a specific instance of the pure-exploration setup of \citet{chen2014combinatorial}.
